## 1. Thought Process & Research Summary

### The Core Question

What does a company actually pay for when it buys Rekindle?

It is buying **three distinct things simultaneously**:

1. **Risk reduction** — every employee on long-term burnout sick leave is a direct balance-sheet liability. In the Netherlands alone, employers must pay 70% of salary for up to two years for any sick employee. A single mid-level burnout case (avg. salary €45k) costs the employer approximately **€63,000** over two years in salary continuation alone — before reintegration costs, replacement hiring, or lost productivity.

2. **Legal compliance** — every target country has specific occupational health laws that either require psychological risk assessments (Germany), mandate a Well-being at Work framework (Belgium), or oblige employers to document psychosocial risk prevention (France). Rekindle provides the tooling and reports that satisfy these obligations.

3. **Productivity & retention** — burnout is the leading cause of long-term absenteeism across Western Europe. The platform's 40% absenteeism reduction and 3x ROI figures map directly onto KPIs that HR and Finance teams are already measured on.

This means pricing must be anchored not to what the software costs to build, but to the **financial risk it eliminates**.

### Cost of Inaction (by country)

| Country | Key Cost Driver | Annual Cost per Burnout Case |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Netherlands | Employer pays 70% salary × 2 years | €63,000+ |
| Germany | 6 weeks full pay + €29.2B national job-strain cost | €8,000–€25,000 |
| Belgium | Work incapacity insurance + replacement cost | €12,000–€20,000 |
| France | RPS legal exposure + sick leave indemnity | €10,000–€18,000 |
| Luxembourg | High salary base + ITM compliance risk | €15,000–€30,000 |

Source: Springer Nature / PMC research on Dutch employer sick leave costs; Gallup "High Cost of Worker Burnout in Germany"; European Commission psychosocial risk study.

### Key Market Statistics

- **25% of German employees** rate their burnout risk as "high" — nearly double the 2018 figure
- German employers lose **€9 billion/year** in lost productivity from worker burnout
- Per-employee annual cost: **€1,199 (absenteeism) + €2,399 (presenteeism)** = €3,598/year (Germany)
- Employees with burnout are **63% more likely to take a sick day**
- Burnout can reduce total organizational output by **18–20%**

## 2. Competitive Landscape

### Direct European Competitors (B2B Mental Health Platforms)

| Platform | Focus | Price Range (PEPM) | Weaknesses vs. Rekindle |
|----------|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Moka | General mental wellness | €5–€20 | No burnout-specific lifecycle, no PFA |
| Teale | Therapy + coaching | €3–€15 | No organizational assessments, no prevention audits |
| Unmind | Self-guided + therapy | £5–£20 | No emergency response, no ROI reporting |
| Oliva | Coaching heavy | £10–£50 | Expensive, UK-centric, limited compliance docs |
| Headspace Business | Mindfulness/prevention | €5–€10 | Self-guided only, no therapy, no org-level tools |
| Traditional EAP | Telephone counselling | €2–€5 | Low utilization (~3%), reactive only, no data |

> PEPM = Per Employee Per Month

### Pricing Benchmarks

```
Budget Tier    €3 – €6 / PEPM    Self-service tools, no clinical support
Mid Tier       €6 – €20 / PEPM   Coaching + limited therapy sessions
Premium Tier   €20 – €50 / PEPM  Clinical therapy, org tools, reporting
```

**Positioning target:** Rekindle should sit in the **mid-to-premium range (€12–€32 PEPM)**, justified by the full burnout lifecycle approach, emergency PFA, organizational-level assessments, and compliance reporting — features absent from most competitors at any price point.

---

## 3. Compliance Value by Country

This is a critical pricing driver. Rekindle is not just a wellness perk — it is a compliance instrument.

### Germany

- **Legal basis:** Arbeitsschutzgesetz (Occupational Safety Act) + 2015 Prevention Act (Präventionsgesetz)
- **Obligation:** Employers must conduct psychological risk assessments (psychische Gefährdungsbeurteilung) as part of their mandatory workplace safety process. Failure is subject to fines by Berufsgenossenschaften (DGUV).
- **Rekindle delivers:** Custom organizational assessments, department-specific stressor identification, annual reports — these directly populate the required risk assessment documentation.
- **Sales angle:** "Rekindle fulfils your psychische Gefährdungsbeurteilung obligations and provides auditable evidence of compliance."

### Netherlands (Highest Urgency Market)

- **Legal basis:** Arbeidsomstandighedenwet (Working Conditions Act), Art. 7:658 Dutch Civil Code
- **Obligation:** Employers are legally required to provide a safe and healthy workplace. Critically, they must **continue paying 70% of salary for 2 full years** for any ill employee — including burnout. This is unique in Europe and creates an enormous financial incentive to prevent burnout proactively.
- **Additional obligation:** Employers must have a certified Arbo (occupational health) service. Rekindle's prevention programs complement and can partially substitute Arbo service costs.
- **Rekindle delivers:** Stress audits, prevention programming, and ROI reports that demonstrate good-faith duty-of-care efforts — critical if an employee later claims the employer failed to prevent burnout.
- **Sales angle:** "One burnout case costs you €63,000. Rekindle for your entire team costs a fraction of that."

### Belgium

- **Legal basis:** Welzijn op het Werk wet (Well-being at Work Act 1996, amended 2014) + 2025 Work Incapacity Reform (coalition agreement)
- **Obligation:** Employers must have a formal prevention plan covering psychosocial risks. The 2025 coalition agreement introduces stricter return-to-work obligations and cost-sharing for long-term incapacity.
- **Rekindle delivers:** Prevention programming and structured assessments that form the basis of a legally required Internal Prevention and Protection Service (IDPB/SIPPT) annual plan.
- **Sales angle:** "Rekindle's structured prevention programs satisfy your psychosocial risk prevention planning requirements under Belgian law."

### France

- **Legal basis:** Code du Travail (Labour Code), Articles L4121-1 to L4121-5 + Accord National Interprofessionnel on Stress (2008)
- **Obligation:** Employers must document and act on all psychosocial risks (Risques Psychosociaux / RPS) in their Document Unique d'Évaluation des Risques Professionnels (DUERP). This document is legally mandatory and must be updated annually.
- **Right to Disconnect (Droit à la déconnexion):** Law for companies with 50+ employees — Rekindle's workload review programs directly support compliance.
- **Rekindle delivers:** Organizational assessments that feed directly into DUERP updates; annual reports serve as documented evidence of psychosocial risk management.
- **Sales angle:** "Rekindle's annual reports and assessments provide the documented RPS action plan your DUERP legally requires."

### Luxembourg

- **Legal basis:** Loi du 17 juin 1994 on occupational health; ITM (Inspection du Travail et des Mines) oversight
- **Market profile:** Smallest market but highest average salary base (EU institutions, finance sector). A single burnout case has the highest financial impact of all target countries.
- **Rekindle delivers:** Full suite applicable; particularly strong ROI case given salary levels.
- **Sales angle:** Premium compliance + wellbeing positioning.

## 4. Usage Frequency Analysis

Understanding how often the platform is used is critical for pricing fairness and SaaS unit economics.

### Employee-Level Usage

| Feature | Expected Monthly Active Users | Frequency |
|---------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Self-assessment tool | 20–35% of enrolled employees | Monthly |
| Prevention content / resources | 15–25% of enrolled employees | Weekly |
| 1-on-1 therapy session | 5–12% of enrolled employees | 1–6x/year |
| Emergency PFA activation | 0.5–2% of enrolled employees | Rare but critical |
| Manager coaching | 8–15% of managers | Quarterly |

### Company-Level Usage

| Feature | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| Organizational stress audit | 1–2x/year |
| Resilience workshops | Quarterly |
| Annual ROI & burnout report | 1x/year |
| Custom department assessments | 1–2x/year |
| Workload review consultation | 1x/year |

**Key insight:** Most employees engage at low frequency, but the *value* of the platform is largely insurance-like — it reduces the probability of a high-cost event. Pricing models that penalize low individual usage (pay-per-session) undermine adoption. The market standard of **PEPM (per employee per month)** is correct here: it aligns incentives for broad enrollment and proactive use.

### Session Economics

If 8% of a 100-person company uses therapy in a given month (8 employees × avg 2 sessions = 16 sessions), and each therapist session costs Rekindle approximately €40–€60 in therapist time, the cost per active therapy user per month is €80–€120. This means therapy session delivery is only sustainable above the base platform fee when active utilization stays below ~15%. Plans must be structured accordingly — either capping sessions or pricing the clinical tier high enough to absorb utilization spikes.

## 5. Rekindle's Differentiators

What justifies Rekindle pricing above Moka, Teale, or a standard EAP?

| Feature | Rekindle | Typical EAP | Headspace Business | Moka / Teale |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Burnout-specific lifecycle (4 phases) | YES | NO | NO | Partial |
| Emergency Psychological First Aid | YES | Sometimes | NO | NO |
| Organizational custom assessments | YES | NO | NO | NO |
| Department-level stressor analysis | YES | NO | NO | NO |
| Annual ROI & analytics report | YES | Rarely | NO | Limited |
| Manager coaching program | YES | NO | NO | Some |
| Workload + structural recommendations | YES | NO | NO | NO |
| Compliance documentation | YES | NO | NO | NO |
| 100+ certified psychologists on platform | YES | Third-party | NO | YES |
| 50% therapy session discount for employees | YES | NO | NO | NO |
| Prevention → Recovery full continuum | YES | NO | NO | Partial |

**Rekindle's core differentiation is that it is the only platform treating burnout as an *organizational* problem, not just an individual one.** Competitors help individuals cope; Rekindle helps companies prevent the conditions that cause burnout in the first place.

### Pricing Summary Table

| Tier | PEPM (annual billing) | PEPM (monthly billing) | Min. Seats | Therapy | OrgAudit | PFA |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|---------|----------|-----|
| Starter | **€5** | €5.75 | 10 | — | — | — |
| Business | **€15** | €17.25 | 15 | 4 sessions/yr | 1/yr | — |

---

## 7. Company Size Tiers & Discounts

Volume discounts reflect the improved unit economics at scale (fewer per-seat onboarding costs, more predictable utilization, higher LTV).

| Company Size | Employees | Volume Discount | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Small | 10–50 | 0% (base price) | Highest per-seat cost to serve; therapy utilization relatively less predictable |
| Mid-Market | 51–250 | 10% off | Predictable utilization, longer sales cycles worth incentivizing |
| Growth | 251–1,000 | 18% off | Strategic accounts; dedicated CSM already included in Enterprise |
| Large Enterprise | 1,001+ | Custom (typically 22–30% off) | Negotiated; often multi-country, multi-year deals |

**Example: 200-employee Dutch company on Business tier**
- List: €15 × 200 = €3,000/month
- 10% mid-market discount = **€2,700/month = €32,400/year**
- Cost per avoided burnout case: one prevented case = €63,000 saved → platform pays for itself in preventing **0.5 cases/year**

## 8. ROI Justification for Buyers

This section is designed to be used in sales conversations and proposal documents.

### The Numbers That Close Deals

**Cost of one unmanaged burnout case (Netherlands, 200-employee company, avg. salary €45k):**

| Cost Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| 2 years sick pay (70% × €45k × 2) | €63,000 |
| Replacement/temp hiring | €15,000 |
| Lost productivity (reintegration period) | €8,000 |
| Management time | €4,000 |
| **Total cost per case** | **~€90,000** |

**Annual Rekindle Business cost (200 employees, mid-market discount):**
€2,700/month × 12 = **€32,400/year**

**Break-even:** Rekindle prevents **less than 0.4 burnout cases per year** to fully pay for itself — before counting the ROI from productivity gains, reduced presenteeism, and improved retention.

**Advertised platform outcomes:**
- **3x ROI** on mental health investment (industry-backed figure)
- **40% reduction in absenteeism**
- Employee therapy at **50% discount** (retention benefit: employees actively value this)

### Compliance Risk Savings

Companies that lack documented psychosocial risk prevention face:
- **Netherlands:** Employee legal claims under Art. 7:658 Dutch Civil Code → potential court-ordered damages
- **Germany:** DGUV fines for missing psychische Gefährdungsbeurteilung documentation
- **France:** Labour inspectorate sanctions for missing/incomplete DUERP RPS section
- **Belgium:** ITM penalties under Welzijn op het Werk Act

A single successful employee liability claim can cost €50,000–€200,000 in settlements. Rekindle's compliance documentation pack provides auditable evidence of good-faith prevention — a direct legal risk hedge.

## 10. Go-to-Market Notes by Country

### Netherlands — Lead Market

- **Why lead here:** 2-year sick pay law creates the strongest financial urgency anywhere in Europe. The ROI argument is almost self-evident.
- **Buyer profile:** HR Director or CFO in companies with 15–500 employees
- **Sales channel:** Partner with Arbo (occupational health) services — they are already in contact with every Dutch employer. Position Rekindle as a complement/upgrade to their standard Arbo package.
- **Language:** Dutch-language interface essential for adoption
- **Pricing note:** Netherlands can sustain full-list pricing. Do not pre-discount here.

### Germany — Strategic Market

- **Why here:** Largest economy in target group; strong Mittelstand (SME) culture; 25% of workforce at high burnout risk; legal psychological risk assessment obligation is under-served by current market.
- **Buyer profile:** HR/People function in companies 50–1,000 employees; also works as a benefit offered by Krankenversicherungen (health insurers) wanting to reduce claims
- **Sales channel:** Target through employer associations (BDA, BDI), and HR technology trade events (DGFP conference, ZukunftPersonal)
- **Language:** German-language platform is mandatory
- **Pricing note:** German buyers are data-driven — the annual ROI report is a key differentiator. Lead with the compliance angle (Gefährdungsbeurteilung) in proposals.

### Belgium — Compliance-Driven Market

- **Why here:** Well-being at Work Act creates a mandatory market; 2025 reform increases cost of non-compliance
- **Buyer profile:** Prevention Advisor (Preventieadviseur / Conseiller en prévention) — this is a legally mandated role in all Belgian companies with 20+ employees and is your primary internal champion
- **Language:** Requires both Dutch (Flemish) and French versions
- **Pricing note:** Mid-market entry; the compliance pack is especially valuable here

### France — Prevention-Culture Market

- **Why here:** France has a strong legal and cultural emphasis on occupational health prevention (RPS/DUERP); SME-focused support programs are a government priority
- **Buyer profile:** DRH (Directeur des Ressources Humaines) or médecin du travail (occupational physician)
- **Sales channel:** Partner with CARSAT (regional occupational health funds) or ARACT (regional improvement associations) who already consult SMEs on psychosocial risk
- **Language:** French-language platform essential
- **Pricing note:** French buyers appreciate structured methodology and references to legal frameworks in proposals. The DUERP compliance angle is the strongest opener.

### Luxembourg — Premium Niche

- **Why here:** High average salaries make cost-per-prevented-burnout-case extremely compelling; EU institutions and finance sector present; small market but high willingness to pay
- **Buyer profile:** HR in finance, consulting, EU-sector companies
- **Pricing note:** Apply full-list Enterprise pricing. Luxembourg companies should not receive standard volume discounts at typical company sizes given market premium.

---

## Summary Recommendation

Rekindle's pricing should be positioned as a **compliance + wellbeing investment**, not a software subscription. The three-tier structure (€5 / €15 / €28 PEPM) places Rekindle firmly in the mid-to-premium European B2B mental health market, justified by:

1. The only platform with a **complete 4-phase burnout lifecycle** (identification → prevention → recovery → post-recovery)
2. **Emergency PFA** — no direct competitor offers on-call psychological first aid
3. **Organizational-level tools** (stress audits, structural recommendations) that competitors do not offer
4. **Compliance documentation** that maps to the legal obligations of all 5 target countries
5. **ROI reporting** that gives HR and Finance quantifiable evidence of platform value

The Netherlands should be the launch priority due to the 2-year sick pay liability creating the strongest and most immediate ROI argument. Germany is the strategic growth market by volume.
